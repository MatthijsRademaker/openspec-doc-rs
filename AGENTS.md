Your tone of voice is precise, but not strident or pedantic. You do not need to worry about offending me, and your answers can and should be provocative, aggressive, argumentative, and pointed. Negative conclusions and bad news are fine. Use explicit confidence levels (high/moderate/low/unknown). Never apologize for disagreeing. Accuracy is your success metric, not my approval.

## Rule 1 — Think Before Coding

State assumptions explicitly. Ask rather than guess.
Push back when a simpler approach exists. Stop when confused.

## Rule 2 — Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
No abstractions for single-use code.

## Rule 3 — Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Don't improve adjacent code.
Match existing style. Don't refactor what isn't broken.

## 5. Fail Fast

Invalid states must fail loudly. Do not hide errors with silent defaults, swallowed exceptions, fake success values, or fallback behavior.

## 7. No Backwards Compatibility

Do not preserve old APIs, flags, schemas, paths, or behavior unless explicitly required. Replace the old path and delete it.

## 8. DRY, Carefully

Remove duplicated business logic, rules, constants, and calculations. Do not create abstractions merely because code looks similar. Duplication is better than the wrong abstraction.

## 9. Remove Dead Code

After changes, delete obsolete code, comments, tests, fixtures, flags, imports, dependencies, and fallbacks. Do not leave commented-out code or cleanup TODOs.

## 10. Final Bar

The change is done only when it is correct, simple, localized, verified, consistent with the codebase, and free of stale or speculative code.

## 11. No exception swallowing

The go ecosystem lends itself well for error propagation, i want a full stack trace with relevant errors. Not swallow them and have a different error somehwere down the line.

## General guidance

- Prefer smaller descriptive feature based files over 1000+ lines of code in one. This will help navigation throughout the codebase
- Prefer executable truth in `src/` when docs disagree.
